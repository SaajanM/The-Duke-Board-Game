In the assets/pngs path there is a subdirectory called tiles.
This file explains the formats and purposes of pngs in this subdirectory, to help support future modifications.

Each file is named after a tile defined in data/tiles/types.json, with matching spelling and capitalization.
The files show the two sides of these tiles, with very specific dimensions, 256x128 pixels.
The pngs will be used to draw the tiles on the board. If they are sized wrong, they will not be drawn correctly.

   side 1       side 2
 ----------- -----------
|           |           |
|  128x128  |  128x128  |
|           |           |

When trying to add a new tile to the game, creating and adding the png for it is one step of the process.
In general, one would also need to modify the json files holding the metadata about the tile.
- Define the tile in data/tiles/types.json, as well as data/tiles/movements.json if it's a troop tile.
    --> See docs/json_formats.txt for details on the json file format.
    --> Make sure that in the json files as well as the png, spelling and capitalization is the same across all.
- Create a png displaying both sides of the tile side by side horizontally, such that one side is 128x128 pixels,
  meaning the full size is 256x128 pixels. The png is placed in assets/pngs/tiles.
    --> If the tile only has one side to be used, the full png can be 128x128 pixels instead.
