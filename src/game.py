        The game is responsible for telling players what they are allowed to do in a given turn.
        The take_turn() function (defined just above) operates by asking the current player to choose what they
            want to do from a set of things they CAN do.
        Therefore, after any player takes their turn (changing the board state), take_turn() then recalculates
            every player's current allowed choices. This is the method that does that calculation.

            would leave the player's Duke in check. If so, then that move is not actually allowed. The process of
            deciding whether a move would leave the Duke in check involves asking the opponent to recalculate what
            their attacks would be were the move to be made. This can be generalized as a call to get_choices() for
            the opponent, but in that call, there is no need to consider Duke safety, as we are only concerned with
            where the opponent can attack. In fact, if the opponent did consider its Duke safety here, it would lead
            to an infinite loop of each player calling get_choices() back and forth for each other, wanting to know
            each other's attacks. So, this boolean should be True for calls that are intended to fully recalculate
            what is allowed, but False when only concerned with where the enemy attacks are.
